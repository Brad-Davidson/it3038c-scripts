# Project 1

### Water Reminder

This program is a simple reminder to stay hydrated. I find myself forgetting to drink regularly, and as a result I have noticed that I end the day feeling slightly dehydrated. This app will simply remind me ever so often to take a few sips of water so that I can proactively hydrate.

Python3 is required to run this app, as well as an additional dependency named win10toast (a library used for notifications). This app will only run on Windows, as the notifications do not work on Linux machines.

To verify that python is installed, run:
```powershell
python --version
```
To install the win10toast library, type:
```powershell
pip install win10toast
```

To run the program, go to the directory that it is downloaded in and type:
```powershell
python Project_1.py
```
